# Isotope Temperature Calibration

In this repository I am working on an R implementation of equations provided by Pryor et al. (2014) for estimating palaeotemperatures
from animal bioapatite oxygen stable isotope values and calculating the propagation or associated errors. Pryor et al. (2014) published 
the mathematical underpinnings as well as an excel template, that can be used to conduct the calculations. To improve automatability and
reproducibility of this calculator I am working to implement it as R scripts that can be automated and more easily documented as part of
a transparent research process. 

The original publication can be found here:

biomineral oxygen isotope data to temperature for palaeoclimate reconstruction. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 412, 99-107.
